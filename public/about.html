<p>Hi, I’m Miranda de Haan, a 40-year-old girl from the Netherlands. I’m passionate about learning and I love exploring new things, whether it’s the world of technology or picking up new languages. I’m fluent in Dutch, English, and German.
</p>

<p>I work as a dental assistant in a small practice. Outside of work, I like reading, writing, or planning my next travel adventure. I’ve been lucky enough to visit some incredible destinations, with Egypt, Thailand, and Portugal holding a special place in my heart for their rich cultures, histories, and stunning landscapes.
  To stay fit I like practicing yoga and Pilates.
</p>

<p>I’m currently learning Egyptian Arabic, and while it’s a challenging journey, it’s incredibly interesting. The process may be slow, yet I’m enthusiastic in learning this beautiful language.
  I approach life with a positive mindset, trusting that everything will be as it’s meant to be.
